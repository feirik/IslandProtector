Island Protector project
=============================
Simple 2D 2 player game created in Qt. Player 1 uses the keyboard arrow keys and space, player 2 uses the mouse. 
Player 2 follows player 1 path with a 2 second delay.

Created using Qt Creator 4.6.1, MinGW 32bit compiler.

**The main lessons learned for the project were:**
- Memory management
- Input/output and action loops
- Object interactions

Possible improvements would be to expand the program with typical game elements, such as starting menu, store high score, different levels etc.
